Description - For our project, we had made a Stock Market Tracker on US Companies. It shows the user a small profile of their ticker symbol and current price. There is also a news feed page which shows us popular business news but can be altered if you input the company you would like to read about.
Motivation for development? - We decided we wanted to build something quite challenging for the project and building an application regarding the stock markets would be really fun and exciting to build.
User story - As a Market Shareholder, I want to see a company's Current Price and Change Live every time the user refresh the page.
